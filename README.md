This project implements a face detection system using Python, leveraging the power of OpenCV library. The system can detect and recognize faces in images and video streams, making it suitable for various applications such as security, user authentication.Face Detection: Accurately detects faces in images using Haar Cascade classifiers.
Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a database of known individuals.
Real-time Processing: Supports real-time face detection using webcam input.
